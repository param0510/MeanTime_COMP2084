<h1>Welcome to MeanTime</h1>
<p>This is a live web app built for COMP2084 Assignment 1</p>
<p>This app can be used by parents to control/manage the kinds of apps their kids have installed on their phone by reviewing real time stats.</p>
<p>It runs on the azure web server and uses the azure database</p>
<p>I have used various bootstrap and 3rd party templates to build the rich view of this site</p>
<p>Here are few of the links ....</p>
<p><a href="https://freefrontend.com/" target="_blank">FreeFrontEnd</a></p>
<p><a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">MDB</a></p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a></p>
<p>I have commented all the sources for the page template in each and every page as well</p>
<p>Moreover I have added 2 advanced functionalities based upon independent learning</p>
<p>1) 1-1 connection between two Model classes Apps and AppDetails, both are linked in such a way that if one gets deleted the other deletes automatically maintaining the database integrity</p>
<p>2) Image is retained when users try to edit an item without uploading a new image</p>
<p>This site also has security features with Google-signup enabled using the Google API from <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis" target="_blank">https://console.cloud.google.com/apis<a></p>
<p>You can view the live site at <a href="https://gc200491057.azurewebsites.net/">https://gc200491057.azurewebsites.net/</a></p>
<p>Thanks for a visit!</p>
